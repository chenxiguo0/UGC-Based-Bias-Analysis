Anybody read this and is it a good place to get started? If so what would be a good book to read next?                                                                                     |
    | Libertarian | m29svuv | comment        | 1     | 1     | Dec-24 | Anything by Fredrich Bastiat is also good but he thinks the State can actually be made to function for the people he was so close to figuring out you can't tame the devil.                                                                                                                                       |
    | Libertarian | m2a5co6 | comment        | 2     | 1     | Dec-24 | Libertarians aren't exclusively anarchists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
    | Libertarian | m2a694w | comment        | 3     | 1     | Dec-24 | "True but like socialists and communists always saying they can fix their ideologies or that wasn't real X others eventually figure out that government can not be fixed no matter what you do. Just like Gun Free Zone signs do not stop would be mass murderers Constitutions do not stop criminals in office." |
    | Libertarian | m2a5co6 | comment        | 1     | 1     | Dec-24 | Libertarians aren't exclusively anarchists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

2.  **Total Posts and Comments:**

    -   The collected dataset contains 59,724 entries, consisting of:

        -   59,032 comments

        -   692 posts, categorized as:

            -   Hot: 347

            -   Controversial: 345

    -   The dataset includes 7 attributes:

        -   **subreddit**: The subreddit from which the post or comment was collected.

        -   **id**: The unique ID number associated with each post or comment.

        -   **type**: Indicates whether the text is a post or a comment.

        -   **depth**: Represents the structural level where the text is located.

        -   **score**: Popularity of the text (calculated as upvotes minus downvotes).

        -   **time**: The year and month when the text was published.

        -   **text**: The exact raw text collected.

3.  **Comment Depth:**

    The comment depth ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the post itself, 1 refers to first-level comments (direct comments on the post), 2 represents second-level comments (replies to the first-level comments), 3 indicates third-level comments (replies to the second-level comments), and so on. The majority of comments, approximately 20,000, are concentrated at depths 2 to 4.

4.  **Score Range**:

    The score ranges from -177 to 57,021, with a mean of 35.95. This wide range suggests that while most comments have low scores, some posts and comments have garnered significant attention or upvotes. While most comments and submissions have low scores (below 10), there are a few with exceptionally high scores, which indicates viral or highly upvoted content.

## Data Resources for Training Sets

For training sets, this project utilized two labeled datasets from Kaggle.

-   training set for Decision Tree binary classification (liberal or conservative)

    [Liberal vs Conservative Title classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/noname666666/liberal-vs-conservative-title-classification)

-   training set for Random Forest regression (value between 0 and 1)

    [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data)

## Challenges

Due to the nature of web scraping with the Reddit API, the datasets collected in this project may not be fully replicable. This is because the data retrieved depends on factors such as time, post popularity, and various dynamic elements within the Reddit platform. Since the Reddit API does not provide a fixed method for data collection, the exact results may vary each time the code is run, making it difficult to reproduce the exact same dataset consistently.
