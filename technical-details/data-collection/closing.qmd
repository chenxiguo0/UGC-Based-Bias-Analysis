# Conclusion

## Key Insights for Test Set

1.  **Total Posts and Comments:**

    The collected data contains 59,724 entries, 59,032 comments, and 692 posts categorized as "hot" (347) or "controversial" (345).

2.  **Comment Depth:**

    The comment depth ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the post itself, 1 refers to first-level comments (direct comments on the post), 2 represents second-level comments (replies to the first-level comments), 3 indicates third-level comments (replies to the second-level comments), and so on. The majority of comments, approximately 20,000, are concentrated at depths 2 to 4.

3.  **Score Range**:

    The score ranges from -177 to 57,021, with a mean of 35.95. This wide range suggests that while most comments have low scores, some posts and comments have garnered significant attention or upvotes. While most comments and submissions have low scores (below 10), there are a few with exceptionally high scores, which likely indicates viral or highly upvoted content.

## Data Resources for Training Sets

For training sets, this project utilized two labelled datasets from Kaggle.

-   training set for Decision Tree binary classification (liberal or conservative)

    [Liberal vs Conservative Title classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/noname666666/liberal-vs-conservative-title-classification)

-   training set for Random Forest regression (value between 0 and 1)

    [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data)

## Challenges

Due to the nature of web scraping with the Reddit API, the datasets collected in this project may not be fully replicable. This is because the data retrieved depends on factors such as time, post popularity, and various dynamic elements within the Reddit platform. Since the Reddit API does not provide a fixed method for data collection, the exact results may vary each time the code is run, making it difficult to reproduce the exact same dataset consistently.
