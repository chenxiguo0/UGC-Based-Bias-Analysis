# Data Pre-Processing

**New Row Added**:

-   "text_length" was added for the diversity and richness of the subsequent analysis.

**Normalization**:

-   Appliec Log-Transform to text length and score for balanced visualization.

**Skewness and Kurtosis Description**:

-   **Depth**:

    -   Skewness: 0.805 (moderate positive skew, meaning most comments are at shallow levels with few at deeper levels).

    -   Kurtosis: 0.055 (flat distribution, with no significant outliers or extreme values).

-   **Score**:

    -   Skewness: 59.793 (strong positive skew, indicating most posts/comments have low scores, but a few have very high scores).

    -   Kurtosis: 4831.850 (highly leptokurtic, with heavy tails and many extreme values, showing a large number of posts with high scores).

-   **Text Length**:

    -   Skewness: 6.563 (strong positive skew, meaning most texts are short, with a few being much longer).

    -   Kurtosis: 78.743 (heavy tails, with a small number of very long texts compared to the majority of shorter ones).

**Dataset Sample**:

## **Key Insights**

-   **Summary of EDA Findings**:
-   Highlight the main takeaways from the EDA process (key trends, patterns, data quality issues).
-   **Implications for Modeling**:
-   Discuss how your EDA informs the next steps in your project (e.g., feature selection, data transformations).
-   Outline any further data cleaning or preparation required before moving into modeling.
