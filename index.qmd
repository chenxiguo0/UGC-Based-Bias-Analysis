# Project Name

## Introduction

This is the landing page for your project. Content from this page can be reused in sections of your final report.

> Doing a project that you think will change the world, only to find at the end that a very similar version of your project was already done in the 1980's, isn't a great use of time.

## Data Science Questions

-   Summarize your topic, its significance, related work, and the questions you plan to explore.
-   Draft an introduction with at least **5 research questions**. These may evolve as your project progresses, since data science is an iterative process.
-   Include your data science questions on this page.

## About Me

This is the landing page for your project. Content from this page can be reused in sections of your final report.

-   Develop your "About You" page. You can reuse content from previous assignments.
-   You can include the content here or on a separate page.
    -   Itâ€™s recommended to create one "About You" page for all DSAN projects, with links to your various class projects.

## Literature Review

Once you decide on a topic, you should `ALWAYS START WITH A LITERATURE REVIEW`, this is particularly important for academic projects.

The literature review is the most important part of most projects.

It allows you to;

-   Determine what is already known and what has already been tried, so that you `don't re-invent the wheel`.

-   It makes you more of a subject matter expert, allowing you to `ask the right questions`, `target impactful projects`, and `communicate with other professionals`.

In this section, please do a literature review and cite at least **3 academic publications** per group member, and include **internal academic citations**.

**Optional**: Consider using LLM tools to 10X your literature review, e.g. instead of focusing on 3 papers, aim for 30 or more

By following these steps, you can 10X the efficiency of your literature review process, gaining more insights while minimizing the time spent on manual reading.

1.  **Expand Your Literature Search**\
    Aim to gather a larger pool of papers. Use academic databases (Google Scholar, arXiv, etc.) to find relevant studies and ensure a broad scope.

2.  **Skim the Abstracts**\
    Read the abstracts of each paper to quickly understand their focus and identify those most relevant to your topic. Prioritize these papers for deeper analysis.

3.  **Use LLM Tools for Summarization**\
    Upload the selected papers to an LLM tool capable of text summarization. Have it condense the main points of each paper into a concise, manageable summary (e.g., condense hundreds of pages into a 10-page summary). Carefully review this summary to absorb the key insights.

4.  **Leverage Interactive LLM Tools**\
    Use tools like NotebookLM or other AI-based text digesters to ask specific, targeted questions about the papers:

    -   Example questions:
        -   "In the papers uploaded, did any of them explore XYZ?"
        -   "Which paper is most closely related to the following project idea: \[explain idea\]?" These tools will help you quickly extract relevant information without re-reading entire papers.
